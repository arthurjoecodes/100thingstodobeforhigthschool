To prevent this from happening, she creates a bucket list filled with things to accomplish before high school.

    <h3>their good</h3>
    <p>
CJ, Fenwick and Crispo win a sleepover at Pootatuck, along with several other students. Despite previous failed attempts, the three are determined to stay awake all night and witness the sunrise, but Principal Hader tries everything she can to make them go to sleep, so that she won't have to deal with the children. Meanwhile, CJ's parents unsuccessfully try to break into the school to give CJ her retainer, despite the fact that the school's doors will not open until the next morning. Her brother manages to break in on the emergency door and give them things to stay awake. In the last moment, Hader catches CJ and her friends, but they manage to see the sunrise and then immediately drop to the floor and fall asleep.
